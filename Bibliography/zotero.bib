	abstract = {This paper deals with inference and prediction for multiple correlated time series, where one also has the choice of using a candidate pool of contemporaneous predictors for each target series. Starting with a structural model for time series, we use Bayesian tools for model ﬁtting, prediction and feature selection, thus extending some recent works along these lines for the univariate case. The Bayesian paradigm in this multivariate setting helps the model avoid overﬁtting, as well as captures correlations among multiple target time series with various state components. The model provides needed ﬂexibility in selecting a diﬀerent set of components and available predictors for each target series. The cyclical component in the model can handle large variations in the short term, which may be caused by external shocks. Extensive simulations were run to investigate properties such as estimation accuracy and performance in forecasting. This was followed by an empirical study with one-step-ahead prediction on the max log return of a portfolio of stocks that involve four leading ﬁnancial institutions. Both the simulation studies and the extensive empirical study conﬁrm that this multivariate model outperforms three other benchmark models, viz. a model that treats each target series as independent, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with regression (ARIMAX), and the multivariate ARIMAX (MARIMAX) model.},

Accurate trend speciﬁcation in long-term forecasting is important; otherwise erroneous forecasts could be obtained especially in South Africa where it is difﬁcult to determine if the trend would continue a downward trajectory or would revert to an upward trajectory. Long-term probabilistic electricity demand forecasts in South Africa from 2013 to 2023 are presented in this paper. The ﬁndings are; (a) electricity demand in South Africa is less likely to exceed the highest historical hourly demand of 36 826 kW until 2023 (b) South African demand from Eskom is more likely to maintain the downward trend until 2023 (c) electricity demand lies between 15 849 kW and 39 810 kW with a 90\% probability between 2013 and 2023. The contributions of the paper are; (a) application of BSTS to longterm electricity demand forecasting (b) use of autocorrelation plot to determine the number of time lags in long-term electricity demand forecasting (c) long-term forecasting of electricity demand using South African data with their uncertainties quantiﬁed.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyse the theoretical pricing of wind power derivatives, which is important for renewable energy risk management but has a problem in the pricing due to the illiquidity of the assets and to show the application of the theory to the practical implementation of the pricing. We make three contributions to the literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a detailed econometric analysis of the wind power futures underlying, i.e., the electricity production based on windmills, resulting in strong support of seasonality and mean reversion in the logit-transformed wind power load factors. Second, after proposing a new model of wind power load factors based on the econometric findings, we analyse the theoretical prices of wind power futures and call option contracts to which the good-deal bounds pricing within an illiquid market situation is applied as well as we show the application of the theory to the practical pricing with the illiquidity. Third, our empirical pricing analysis shows that theoretical wind power futures prices derived using seasonal modelling more accurately reflect reality than those derived without seasonality compared to market observations, resulting in the importance of seasonality modelling in theoretical wind power derivatives pricing. In particular, considering that the upper and lower price boundaries represent the selling and the buying prices in the incomplete market, respectively, we show that the pricing of the short position is more affected by the seasonality than the pricing of the long position. Finally, we illustrate and discuss the practical applications of the results obtained in our study.},

Therefore, it is imperative to develop strategies to effectively stabilize their revenues, or cash ﬂows, when trading wind power output in the electricity market. In light of this context, we present a novel endeavor to construct multivariate derivatives for mitigating the risk of ﬂuctuating cash ﬂows that are associated with trading wind power generation in electricity markets. Our approach involves leveraging nonparametric techniques to identify optimal payoff structures or compute the positions of derivatives with ﬁne granularity, utilizing multiple underlying indexes including spot electricity price, area-wide wind power production index, and local wind conditions. These derivatives, referred to as mixed derivatives, offer advantages in terms of hedge effectiveness and contracting efﬁciency. Notably, we develop a methodology to enhance the hedge effects by modeling multivariate functions of wind speed and wind direction, incorporating periodicity constraints on wind direction via tensor product spline functions. By conducting an empirical analysis using data from Japan, we elucidate the extent to which the hedge effectiveness is improved by constructing mixed derivatives from various perspectives. Furthermore, we compare the hedge performance between high-granular (hourly) and low-granular (daily) formulations, revealing the advantages of utilizing a high-granular hedging approach.},

Therefore, in order to achieve a better estimation of the tail of the wind speed distribution, we advance a Generalized Pareto distribution. We considered one aspect of the wind turbines reliability by modeling their failure events as a compound Poisson process. Finally, the use of Copula enables us to consider the correlation between wind turbines that compose the wind farm. Once this procedure is set up, we show a sensitivity analysis and we also compare the results from the proposed procedure with a simplistic energy prediction using the Weibull distribution.},

With the rapid growth of wind power capacity due to efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the demand for wind derivatives to manage uncertainty in wind power production is expected to increase. However, existing wind derivative literature often assumes normally distributed wind speed, despite the presence of skewness and leptokurtosis in historical wind speed data. This paper investigates how the misspeciﬁcation of wind speed models affects wind derivative prices and proposes the use of the generalized hyperbolic distribution to account for non-normality. The study develops risk-neutral approaches for pricing wind derivatives using the conditional Esscher transform, which can accommodate stochastic processes with any distribution, provided the moment-generating function exists. The analysis demonstrates that model risk varies depending on the choice of the underlying index and the derivative’s payoff structure. Therefore, caution should be exercised when choosing wind speed models. Essentially, model risk cannot be ignored in pricing wind speed derivatives.},

	abstract = {One of the common goals of time series analysis is to use the observed series to inform predictions for future observations. In the absence of any actual new data to predict, cross-validation can be used to estimate a model’s future predictive accuracy, for instance, for the purpose of model comparison or selection. Exact crossvalidation for Bayesian models is often computationally expensive, but approximate cross-validation methods have been developed, most notably methods for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). If the actual prediction task is to predict the future given the past, LOO-CV provides an overly optimistic estimate because the information from future observations is available to influence predictions of the past. To properly account for the time series structure, we can use leave-future-out cross-validation (LFO-CV). Like exact LOO-CV, exact LFO-CV requires refitting the model many times to different subsets of the data. Using Pareto smoothed importance sampling, we propose a method for approximating exact LFO-CV that drastically reduces the computational costs while also providing informative diagnostics about the quality of the approximation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore two strategies for reducing the cash flow uncertainty of wind energy producers ascribed to variable weather conditions. The first strategy is based on the idea of aggregating the output of geographically-dispersed generating units. The second strategy employs financial instruments that compensate producers for unanticipated declines in the power delivery. Using a blend of advanced weather modeling, time series analysis, simulation and optimization techniques, we empirically access the ability of the two risk management approaches to control volumetric risk in Spain. With the aid of factor analysis techniques, we proceed with the decomposition of the remaining risk levels and assess the exposure of each strategy’s revenue to systematic risk factors. Motivated by the results of this analysis, we propose new financial contracts and mixed-style strategies that are better suited to the risk position of each market player.},

These risks could be hedged using weather ﬁnancial instruments. In this research, we design and price an up-and-in European wind put barrier option using Monte Carlo simulation. Under the existence of a structured weather market, wind producers may purchase an up-and-in European wind barrier put option to hedge wind ﬂuctuations, allowing them to recover their investments and maximise their proﬁts. We use a wind speed index as the underlying index of the barrier option, which captures risk from wind power generation and the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) to model the wind speed. This methodology is applied in the Colombian context, an electricity market affected by the El Niño phenomenon. We ﬁnd that when the El Niño phenomenon occurs, there are incentives for wind generators to sell their energy to the system because their costs, including the put option price, are lower than the power prices. This research aims at encouraging policymakers and governments to promote renewable energy sources and a ﬁnancial market to trade options to reduce uncertainty in the electrical system due to climate phenomena.},

Time series models are excellent for random data if the model type and the model order are known. For unknown data characteristics, a large number of candidate models have to be computed. This necessarily includes too low or too high model orders and models of the wrong types, thus requiring robust estimation methods. The computer selects a model order for each of the three model types. From those three, the model type with the smallest expectation of the prediction error is selected. That unique selected model includes precisely the statistically significant details that are present in the data.},

The main aim of this paper is to provide an insight into the impact of weather risk on economic activity of companies operating in the energy sector in Poland. The empirical objective is to examine whether energy companies: (i) identify their relevant weather risk exposures; (ii) evaluate the impact of weather risk in the cost-revenues dimension; and (iii) implement weather risk management tools, in this case—weather derivatives. In a methodical context, this study relies on a unique research approach and derives from works that examine companies’ risk disclosures in annual reports, by applying textual content analysis. The results indicate that Polish energy companies recognize the impact of weather risk on their performance, also in the cost-revenues dimension. However, although the reported weather risk management methods were diversified, the examined companies did not use weather derivatives to hedge their weather risk exposures. In the overall dimension, the companies leading with the perception and management of weather risk were diversified regarding performance and market size.},

Employing the models to wind index data for wind sites in Germany and the underlying wind index of exchange-traded wind power futures contracts, the estimation results of both models suggest that they capture key statistical features of the data. We argue how these models can be used to find optimal hedging strategies using exchange-traded wind power futures for the owner of a portfolio of so-called tailor-made wind power futures. Both in-sample and out-of-sample hedging scenarios are considered, and, in both cases, significant variance reductions are achieved. Additionally, the risk premium of the German wind power futures is analysed, leading to an indication of the risk premium of tailor-made wind power futures.},

The book covers energy markets for electricity, natural gas, coal, oil and the market for emission certificates. It also focuses on the renewable energy sector, particularly the energy economic principles, value drivers and risks related to hydro, wind, solar and bio energy. This text integrates energy economic approaches, including fundamental market models with financial engineering approaches commonly used in banks and other trading companies. This includes trading, valuation and risk management of spot products, commodity futures and swaps, structured products such as swing contracts and real options like power plants or gas storages. A multi–commodity approach is taken, covering the mutual influences of electricity, fuels and emission markets. Advantages and disadvantages of different modelling and risk management approaches for practical usage are discussed throughout. Written for researchers and professionals, Managing Energy Risk Second Edition , is an ideal reference for those from an energy economics background as well as those with experience in financial mathematics or trading.

The proposed models are illustrated in the analysis of temperature and wind speed data. The first model use FDA to estimate temperature from climate zones applying functional principal components analysis (FPCA) at all meteorological stations of Lithuania and predicting full log wind speed and annual log wind speed from temperature climate zones resulted from FPCA. The second model predicts log wind speed directly from temperature observations.

We estimate volatility by the time-weighted realized variance acknowledging that empirical intraday prices are not equally spaced in time. Empirical evidence suggests that volatility of electricity futures decreases as time approaches maturity, while coincidently liquidity increases. Established continuous-time stochastic models for electricity futures prices involve a growing volatility function in time and are thus not able to capture our empirical findings a priori. We demonstrate that incorporating increasing liquidity into the established models is key to model the decreasing volatility evolution.},

Thus, it has become increasingly important to enhance management capabilities regarding the aggregation of distributed electricity production and demand through different types of virtual power plants (VPPs). It is also important to exploit their ability to participate in electricity markets to maximize operating profits. This review article focuses on the classification and in-depth analysis of recent studies that propose VPP models including interactions with different types of energy markets. This classification is formulated according to the most important aspects to be considered for these VPPs. These include the formulation of the model, techniques for solving mathematical problems, participation in different types of markets, and the applicability of the proposed models to real case studies. From the analysis of the studies, it is concluded that the most recent models tend to be more complete and realistic in addition to featuring greater diversity in the types of electricity markets in which VPPs participate. The aim of this review is to identify the most profitable VPP scheme to be applied in each regulatory environment. It also highlights the challenges remaining in this field of study.},

	abstract = {IntroductionThe climate change such as Rain, Snow, Heat, etc is creating big losses to those corporate, whose production and Revenue depends a lot on the unexpected shiftof such climatic changes. As for example an umbrella manufacturing company may suffer a great loss of its revenue if there is no rainfall in the rainy season. Similarly if the summers are less than normal scorching a softdrink industry may suffer a loss due to decreased sale. According to JeffLazo, an NCAR scientist ,there is a significant impact of weather in each sector of the economy in US. According to the findings, the economic cost of the weather was estimated to be \$485 billion per year, adjusting \$240 billion. The cost of regular weather variability on the economy is as much as 3.4 percent of the total U.S. GDP. It is estimated that nearly 30\% of the US economy is directly affected by the weather and that the profitability and revenues of virtually every industry - agriculture, energy, entertainment, construction, travel and others- depend to a great extent on the vagaries of temperature. In a 1998 testimony to Congress, former commerce secretary William Daley stated," Weather is not just an environmental issue; it is a major economic factor. At least \$ 1 trillion of our economy is weather- sensitivei. Thus the unexpected change in the weather has created a great threat to the profitability of the industrial houses whose revenue depends on the weather to the great extent and at the same time it has created the opportunity for the investor who wants to trade on these weather fluctuations. Weather derivatives are one of the fastest growing segments of the commodities market. These financial instruments are used by companies to hedge against the risk of weather-related losses.ii (Garman et al, 2000) estimated the trading size of weather derivative to be around US\$3.5 billion which when compared to the total exposure, seems to be a diminutive amount. This risk due to unpredictable weather can be diversified by the new market innovation, which we know as weather derivative. Until recent times insurance was considered to be the main tool for protection against unexpected weather conditions. But it was only the protection for the catastrophic damage. It failed to protect the loss against the reduced demand that business experience as a result of weather that is unexpected. Considering the loss due routine weather fluctuations, the concept of weather derivative was developed. This is a fascinating innovation in the financial market making pre-specified payouts if pre-specified weather events occur. The main derivative instrument includes weather swaps, vanilla options, option collars and exotic options. The underlying includes heating degree-days, cooling maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, humidity and sunshineiii.Meaning of Weather Derivatives:Financial instruments which are employed to minimize the risk associated with adverse weather situation by the organizations or individuals are termed as weather derivatives. The value of the contract depends upon the weather conditions like rainfall, temperature snow etc. The underlying asset for weather derivatives is weather measure which depends upon the nature of individual contracts. (Paul Jayeeta, 2013) differentiated it from other derivatives on the basis that the underlying assets in weather derivatives does not have a direct value to price.( Hurduzeu \& Constantin, 2008) also substantiated the difference between weather and other derivatives on the foundation of tradability of support asset.Generally the weather derivatives depend upon:* Heating degree days : HDD days is the measurement premeditated to reflect the requisite of energy to heat a building which is directly proportional to the quantity of HDD in that location.* Cooling degree days: CDD days is the measurement premeditated to reflect the requisite of energy to cool a building* Precipitation or snowfall over a given period of timeThe main derivative instrument includes* weather swaps,* vanilla options,* option collars* exotic options. …},

Weather derivatives are important additions to firm portfolios of risk management tools. Purchasing weather derivatives will improve the owner's ability to forecast revenues and assure expenditure coverage, both important goals for a small business owner.Practical implications – Many firms find the uneven revenue streams associated with their industry to be difficult to manage. One of the primary risks faced by firms is exposure to weather phenomena. With the introduction of weather derivatives, firms can now hedge their exposure to climatologic events. The application for weather derivatives is quite limitless. Weather derivatives are a relatively new product, and most firms are either unaware of their existence or believe them to be complicated. It is an industry that may experience explosive growth in the coming years.Originality/value – This paper demonstrates the use of derivatives to hedge exposure to climatic events.},

The paper concludes by reflecting on the challenges of research collaboration across the human–physical geography divide and suggests that while such initiatives may be undermined by a range of institutional and intellectual factors, conversations between physical and human geographers remain and are likely to become increasingly pertinent. The creation of a market in weather derivatives raises a host of urgent political and regulatory questions and the confluence of natural and social knowledges, co-existing within and through the geography academy, provides a constructive and creative basis from which to engage with this new market and wider discourses of uneven economic development and climate change.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the index-based weather products (also called weather derivatives) have been gaining attention in the climate resilience discussion. Weather derivatives are designed to help companies hedging against climate variability. These products, that can be market-traded or over-the-counter, compensate individuals based on a pre-defined weather index. Thus, pay-offs of a weather derivative depend on a weather index and not, as with traditional types of insurance, on the actual amount of money lost due to adverse weather. One of the major drawbacks that may prevent weather derivatives to catch on is the impact of the Geographical Basis Risk (GBR), that is the deviation of weather conditions at different locations. In fact, when the reference weather station is not located in the immediate vicinity of the site of interest the hedging effectiveness may be reduced. In this paper, we contribute to the existing literature on GBR by proposing an optimization method that may help in offering a tailored solution, while at the same time keeping a standardized instrument as a reference. Using a historical record of Italian temperatures, strikes for temperatures are the choice variables of a penalty function containing pay-offs of a reference station and all other stations. Further, altitude and latitude of meteorological stations are shown to be relevant predictors to explain GBR. This can be an interesting starting point for the design of weather derivatives, since, from a unique station where the “reference” derivative is priced, all the other stations may be easily settled.},

	abstract = {In markets with a high proportion of wind generation, high wind outputs tend to induce low market prices and, alternatively, high prices often occur under low wind output conditions. Wind producer revenues are affected adversely in both situations. Whilst it is not possible to directly hedge revenues, it is possible to hedge wind speed with weather insurance and market prices with forward derivatives. Thus combined hedges are offered to the wind producers through bilateral arrangements and as a consequence, the risk managers of wind assets need to be able to forecast fair prices for them. We formulate these hedges as binary option contracts on the combined uncertainties of wind speed and market price and provide a new analysis, based upon machine learning classification, to forecast fair prices for such hedges. The proposed forecasting model achieves a classification accuracy of 88 percent and could therefore aid the wind producers in their negotiations with the hedge providers. Furthermore, in a realistic example, we find that the predicted costs of such hedges are quite affordable and should therefore become more widely adopted by the insurers and wind generators.},

Aiming for an effective strategy to control those risks, we construct a hedging portfolio based on energy and weather derivatives, which can minimize the revenue fluctuations. To this end, we provide unique methods by applying nonparametric regression techniques to synthesize the payoff functions of derivatives that change with time, based on tensor product spline functions. The proposed methodology enables us to incorporate two dimensional smoothing conditions of the underlying asset price and expiration date with a yearly cyclical trend. Moreover, we show that the applied method of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) decomposition can separate deterministic time trends from the original multivariate payoff functions, and hence, a simultaneous estimation of multiple derivatives payoff functions is achieved. By assuming that revenues have yearly cyclical trends even when viewed at the rate of annual change, we also introduce a spline function with cross variables to consider such a mixed effect. In addition, we propose new standardized derivatives with the square of the temperature prediction error as the underlying asset. Empirical analysis using data from both the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX) and PJM in the U.S. demonstrates the significant hedging effect and supports the versatility of the proposed modeling approach.},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy has introduced great risks to energy systems and markets. As a result, extensive research on energy storage systems (ESS) has been undertaken to address the risks caused by renewable energy. Among different types of ESSs, the power-to-gas (P2G) storage devices are of great potential. Thus, P2G has been used in this paper as a storage device to provide gas fuel for gas power generators. The aim of this paper is to investigate a portfolio strategy for gas generators to earn profits and hedge risks in three different electricity markets, namely, the spot, the ancillary, and the financial markets. The presented approach is to apply energy storage and financial derivatives to hedge the market risks of gas generators, including short put option and short call option, and the option value deduction process is also involved. Simulations are carried out based on the real historical data from 2016 to 2018 in Australian electricity markets. Three cases are presented, namely, the traditional model, the individual market case, and the proposed portfolio model. Based on the comparison of the three cases, simulation results show that the proposed portfolio model will help gas generators to earn a return of 1.0429 and hedge risks down to 0.0018. It has been found that the returns of the proposed model from 2016 to 2018 are 26.3\% higher, whereas the risks are 88.1\% lower on average comparing with the traditional model and the individual market case.},

Taking the view of an owner of such a physical renewable asset we showcase the management of the associated stochastic production risks in Germany, one of the most dynamic electricity markets and the largest producer of renewable energy in the EU-28. We find that unhedged renewable portfolios are very risky and existing vanilla derivatives are poor hedges. New exotic quantity-related weather contracts proposed by major energy exchanges (EEX) show a lot of potential but are still very illiquid. Their hedging performance is heavily driven by the market wide renewable generation portfolio which, in its current state, favors specific regions.

The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) we introduce a copula-based pricing methodology for multivariate CDs/WDs, whose flexible theoretical framework allows to be suited to any pricing application and possible structure of multivariate products, and (ii) we discuss the impact of CDs/WDs on climate risk and their implication for financial stability. Using the proposed framework, we illustrate a calibration example on a case study on Italian data. We find that Archimedean copula functions characterized by left tail dependence are generally more suitable to fit the data, depending on the season and the location. We also explore the advantages of using more sophisticated, i.e. multivariate, functions and assess the improvement of fitting. Subsequently, leveraging both the theoretical model and the empirical results, we discuss the relation between climate risk hedging and financial stability. Especially, we move from modeling complexities and limitations to illustrate how incorrect calculations (i.e. mispricings, or over/under estimations of capital at risk) can, alongside with climate change effect, increase rather than reduce the climate physical risk and hence the concerns for financial stability. Finally, we discuss this point in relation with the legislative framework, noting how, in the current context of uncertain legislation and imperfect pricing, climate hedging risks are likely to do more harm than good.},

	abstract = {For large energy consumers transitioning to high shares of solar energy, irradiance variability causes volatility in power generation and energy expenditures. Volatility in an end user’s cash flow is harmful to their financial health, especially in abnormally cloudy years. This paper explores the utility of an irradiance-based weather derivative in mitigating cloud weather risk and measures the effectiveness of the developed derivative by applying it to a case study of two Chilean copper mines. Weather derivatives are financial instruments tied to an underlying weather variable that act as an insurance for the contract holder, executing indemnity payments based on an index value. This research develops a contract with a combined index based on monthly sums of irradiance and cloudy day sequencing to mitigate a solar mine’s weather risk. The design and evaluation of contracts are based on LEELO, a linear optimization model outputting optimal sizes of solar photovoltaic, battery storage, and power-to-gas systems, as well as the operation of these systems for a given mine’s load, irradiance and technology costs. Results indicate contracts are effective in cloudier climates with increasing utility for mines installing solar energy systems until the year 2030. After 2030 batteries begin to become a more cost-effective risk-hedging mechanism as they become more affordable.},

Weather-related derivatives are being employed more frequently in alternative risk portfolios with multiple asset classes. We ﬁrst propose an uncertain process that uses data from the past to describe how the temperature has changed. Despite this, pricing these assets is diﬃcult since it necessitates an incomplete market framework. The volatility is described by a truncated Fourier series, and we provide a novel technique for calculating this constant using Monte Carlo simulations. With this approach, the risk is assumed to have a ﬁxed market price.},

The spot and futures price models are ﬁtted jointly, including the market price of risk parameterized from an Esscher transform. We apply this model to price call and put options on power futures. It is argued theoretically that the pricing measure for options may be different to the pricing measure of futures from spot in power markets due to the non-storability of the electricity spot. Empirical evidence pointing to this fact is found from option prices observed at the European Electricity Exchange.},

The author calculates variance and volatility swaps for this model and provides hedging techniques. The book considers content on the pricing of variance and volatility swaps and option pricing formula for mean-reverting models in energy markets.

	abstract = {​Weather derivatives are financial instruments that can be used by organizations or individuals as part of a risk management strategy to minimize risk associated with adverse or unexpected weather conditions. Just as traditional contingent claims, a weather derivative has an underlying measure, such as: rainfall, wind, snow or temperature. Nearly \$1 trillion of the U.S. economy is directly exposed to weather-related risk. More precisely, almost 30\% of the U.S. economy and 70\% of U.S. companies are affected by weather. The purpose of this monograph is to conduct an in-depth analysis of financial products that are traded in the weather market. Presenting a pricing and modeling approach for weather derivatives written on various underlying weather variables will help students, researchers, and industry professionals accurately price weather derivatives, and will provide strategies for effectively hedging against weather-related risk. This book will link the mathematical aspects of the modeling procedure of weather variables to the financial markets and the pricing of weather derivatives. Very little has been published in the area of weather risk, and this volume will appeal to graduate-level students and researchers studying financial mathematics, risk management, or energy finance, in addition to investors and professionals within the financial services industry. ​},

Indeed, futures contracts permit to fix the price of electricity in advance for the use in the scheduled period. Our paper is devoted specifically to the Italian electricity market. In this respect, we examine empirical data from IDEX, the Energy Derivatives part of the Italian derivatives market IDEM, administered by “Borsa Italiana.” We finally survey the possible connections concerning futures and spot prices and, as a consequence, we deduce information about important indicators whereof the ex-post risk premium and the net convenience yield.

This order belongs to the family of complex orders, which introduce non-convexities in the market clearing problem. We demonstrate via simple numerical examples that if more of such bids are present in the market, their interplay may open the possibility of strategic bidding. More precisely, we show that by the manipulation of bid parameters, a strategic player may increase its own proﬁt and potentially induce the deactivation of an other minimum income condition order, which would be accepted under truthful bidding. Furthermore, we show that if we modify the objective function used in the market clearing according to principles suggested in the literature, it is possible to prevent the possibility of such strategic bidding, but the modiﬁcation raises other issues.},

We prove that intra-day hedging with forward contracts is sub-optimal compared to financial options and physical assets. By demonstrating the contribution of intra-day hedging with options and physical assets, we highlight the specificities of electricity markets as hourly markets with strong volatility during peak hours. By simulating optimal hedging strategies, our article proposes a range of new portfolios for electricity retailers to manage their risks and reduce their sourcing costs. A lower hedging cost enables to allocate more resources to digitalization and energy efficiency services to take into account customers’ expectations for more climatefriendly retailers. This is a virtuous circle. Retailers provide high value-added energy efficiency services so that consumers consume less. The latter contributes to reach electricity reduction targets to fight climate warming.},

	abstract = {Generation from wind power plants is intermittent and affects proﬁts of wind power generators and conventional generators alike. Currently, generators have limited options for transferring the resulting wind-related volume risks. The European Energy Exchange (EEX) recently introduced exchange-traded wind power futures to address this market imperfection. We propose a stylized equilibrium pricing model featuring two representative agents and analyze equilibrium prices as well as the mechanics behind risk premia for wind power futures. We calibrate and simulate stochastic models for wind power generation, power prices, electricity demand, as well as other relevant sources of uncertainty and use the resulting scenarios to conduct a case study for the German market; analyzing prices, hedging effectiveness, and risk premia. Our main result suggests that wind generators are willing to pay an insurance premium to conventional generators to reduce their risks. We conduct a thorough sensitivity analysis to test the inﬂuence of model parameters and ﬁnd that our results on risk premia hold for a broad range of reasonable inputs.},

	abstract = {Predicting future solar conditions is important for electricity industries with solar power generators to quote a day-ahead sales contract in the electricity market. If a prediction error exists, the market-monitoring agent has to prepare another power generation resource to immediately compensate for the shortage, resulting in an additional cost. In this context, a penalty may be required depending on the size of the prediction error, which may lead to a significant loss for solar power producers. Because the main source of such losses is from prediction errors of solar conditions, they can instead effectively utilize a derivative contract based on solar prediction errors. The objective of this work is to provide such a derivative contract, namely, a prediction error weather derivative. First, defining a certain loss function, we measure the hedge effect of the derivative on solar radiation prediction error, thereby verifying that the existing hedging method for wind power can also be applied to solar power generation with periodic trends. By introducing the temperature derivative on the absolute prediction error, we also propose a cross-hedging method, where we demonstrate not only a further variance reduction effect when used with solar radiation derivatives, but also a certain hedge effect obtained even when only the temperature derivative is used. For temperature derivative pricing and optimal contract volume estimation, we propose a method using a tensor-product spline function that simultaneously incorporates the smoothing conditions of both the direction of intraday time trend and seasonal trend, and consequently verify its effectiveness.},

We refer to this model as a multivariate exponential tilting process. We then compare using a time series of daily log-returns and market prices of European-style quanto options the relative performance of the exponential tilting process to that of the Black–Scholes and the normal tempered stable process. We find that, due to more flexibility on capturing the information of tails and skewness, the proposed modeling process is superior to the other two processes for fitting market distribution and pricing quanto options.},

At equilibrium the weather derivative market will be cleared and their market price can be obtained. Numerical examples illustrate the equilibrium prices and optimal choices for the weather derivative as function of the correlation between weather indices and demand for the underlying commodity.

Next, we propose a static risk management policy originating from hedging against volumetric risk due to drops in wind intensity and we discuss the consequences. The hedging effectiveness firstly requires adequate modeling calibration and an extensive knowledge of these atypical financial (commodity) markets. In this hedging experiment, we find significant benefits for weather-sensitive companies, which can lead to new business opportunities. We provide a new financial econometrics approach to derive weather risk exposure in a typical wind farm. Our results show how accurate risk management can have a real benefit on corporate revenues. Specifically, we apply the spot market price simulation (SMaPS) model for the spot price of electricity. The parameters are calibrated using the prices of the French day-ahead market, and the historical series of the total hourly load is used as the final consumption. Next, we analyze wind speed and its relationship with electricity spot prices. As our main contribution, we demonstrate the effects of a hypothetical hedging strategy with collar options implemented against volumetric risk to satisfy demand at a specific time. Regarding the hedged portfolio, we observe that the “worst value” increases considerably while the earnings-at-risk (EaR) decreases. We consider only volumetric risk management, thus neglecting the market risk associated with electricity price volatility, allowing us to conclude that the hedging operation of our industrial portfolio provides substantial benefits in terms of the worst-case scenario.},

Multi-process models introduce uncertainty as to the underlying model itself, and this approach is described in a more general fashion than in our 1971 paper. Applications to four series are described in a sister paper.

The basic idea is to drive the seasonal summation model by a moving average process rather than by a white noise or an AR process. Generally, such an approach can be exhaustive in parameters, but the proposed model is parsimonious in the sense that we have only one extra parameter compared to the basic structural time series model. Because we stay at the linear Gaussian assumption, the estimation is quite easy and fast. The state space representation of the model is also given. An interpretation of moving average driven seasonal model is provided in terms of the offset effect on the pseudo-spectrum around the seasonal frequencies. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is richly expressive in estimating the seasonal component, and is also supported by the minimum AIC procedure. A few cases where the proposed method is not working well provide us some useful information on the possible misspeciﬁcation. Focusing attention on the two key quantities implied by the estimated models, we propose a graphical representation for the estimated models that help us to discover the unsuccessful cases and to conﬁrm whether or not the alternative speciﬁcation improves the modeling.},

Specifically, we study the usefulness of continuous bimodal priors to model hypervariance parameters, and the effect scaling has on the posterior mean through its relationship to penalization. Several model selection strategies, some frequentist and some Bayesian in nature, are developed and studied theoretically. We demonstrate the importance of selective shrinkage for effective variable selection in terms of risk misclassification, and show this is achieved using the posterior from a rescaled spike and slab model. We also show how to verify a procedure's ability to reduce model uncertainty in finite samples using a specialized forward selection strategy. Using this tool, we illustrate the effectiveness of rescaled spike and slab models in reducing model uncertainty.},

Its development requires only elementary mathematics, yet it contains as a special limiting case the celebrated Black-Scholes model, which has previously been derived only by much more difficult methods. The basic model readily lends itself to generalization in many ways. Moreover, by its very construction, it gives rise to a simple and efficient numerical procedure for valuing options for which premature exercise may be optimal.},

	abstract = {The fourth edition of this textbook on pricing and hedging of financial derivatives, now also including dynamic equilibrium theory, continues to combine sound mathematical principles with economic applications. Concentrating on the probabilistic theory of continuous time arbitrage pricing of financial derivatives, including stochastic optimal control theory and optimal stopping theory, the book is designed for graduate students in economics and mathematics, and combines the necessary mathematical background with a solid economic focus. It includes a solved example for every new technique presented, contains numerous exercises, and suggests further reading in each chapter. All concepts and ideas are discussed, not only from a mathematics point of view, but the mathematical theory is also always supplemented with lots of intuitive economic arguments. In the substantially extended fourth edition Tomas Björk has added completely new chapters on incomplete markets, treating such topics as the Esscher transform, the minimal martingale measure,
              f-divergences
              , optimal investment theory for incomplete markets, and good deal bounds. There is also an entirely new part of the book presenting dynamic equilibrium theory. This includes several chapters on unit net supply endowments models, and the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross equilibrium factor model (including the CIR equilibrium interest rate model). Providing two full treatments of arbitrage theory—the classical delta hedging approach and the modern martingale approach—the book is written in such a way that these approaches can be studied independently of each other, thus providing the less mathematically oriented reader with a self-contained introduction to arbitrage theory and equilibrium theory, while at the same time allowing the more advanced student to see the full theory in action.},
