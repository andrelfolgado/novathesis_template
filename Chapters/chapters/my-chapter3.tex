\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:rs_intro}

    The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift towards sustainability,
    with an increasing reliance on renewable energy sources.
    The integration of wind and solar assets into energy portfolios presents unique challenges,
    necessitating a thorough investigation into effective hedging strategies.
    This thesis research seeks to address these challenges by focusing on the development of robust models and strategies
    for managing wind and solar assets within a realistic portfolio context.

\section{Objectives of the Research}
    \label{sec:rs_objectives}

%\subsection{Problem Definition}
%    \label{subsec:rs_problem-definition}

    The central problem addressed in this research is the effective hedging of renewable energy sources,
    specifically wind and solar, within the complexity of a realistic portfolio.
    My research aims to understand and apply sensible derivative weather instruments to hedge wind and solar assets,
    taking into account a certain risk profile.
    In the following subsections, I will present the objectives of the research and some methodologies that have been
    indentified to achieve them.

\subsection{Forecasting Electricity Spot Prices}
    \label{subsec:rs_forecasting-electricity-spot-prices}

    Approaches to modelling electricity prices can be broadly categorised into two groups.
    On one end of the spectrum are methods that heavily borrow from reduced-form models
    commonly employed in equity or interest rate markets.
    Early studies utilised low-dimensional stochastic processes to depict patterns
    such as mean-reversion and seasonalities.
    To account for distinctive price spikes not observed in other commodity markets,
    various researchers explored variations of jump processes.\\

    The opposite end of the spectrum involves structural production cost models, also known as fundamental models.
    In these modelling approaches, wholesale market clearing prices arise from a cost minimisation problem
    where demand needs to be met while adhering to specific constraints, such as transmission limitations.
    This approach necessitates comprehensive information on the technical specifics of power plants and
    the environmental constraints of the entire power market under consideration.\\

    \textbf{\textit{Methodology: }} Although from work experience, I am familiar with the fundamentals models.
    If applied to the MIBEL market, I am inclined to use the reduced-form models, such as the SMAaPS mode\cite{burger_spot_2004}.

\subsection{Forecasting Wind Speed and Solar Irradiance}
    \label{subsec:rs_forecasting-wind-speed-and-solar-irradiance}

    Predicting wind speed and solar irradiance with precision is imperative for optimising the performance of
    wind and solar assets.
    This research endeavors to develop meteorological models that account for specific asset locations and heights.\\

    \textbf{\textit{Methodology: }} Leveraging advanced meteorological models,
    such as econometrics or multivariate models\cite{benth_multivariate_2019},
    to simulate and predict wind speed and solar irradiance.


\subsection{Computing Load Based on Weather Conditions}
    \label{subsec:forecasting-load-based-on-weather-conditions}

    The interdependence of load on forecasted weather conditions is a critical factor in energy management.
    This research aims to integrate forecasted wind speeds and solar irradiance into independent asset properties,
    e.g. \ power and location, to calculate load forecasting models.\\

\textbf{\textit{Methodology: }} Defining and apply parametric asset properties, such as power and location,
    to compute load forecasting models.

\subsection{Stochastic Interest Rate Structure}
    \label{subsec:rs_stochastic-interest-rate-structure}

    The stochastic nature of interest rates necessitates approach to modelling discounted cash flows would bring a
    more robust analysis and provide essential insights to when would be the best time to perform hedging operation.\\

    \textbf{\textit{Methodology: }} Utilizing stochastic calculus
    and financial modelling techniques\cite{filipovic_term-structure_2009}.

\subsection{Discounted Cash Flow}
    \label{subsec:rs_stochastic-process-for-discounted-cash-flow}

    The uncertainty associated with renewable energy projects requires a
    stochastic approach to model discounted cash flows.
    This research seeks to develop a Monte Carlo analysis of the wind, prices and interest rates stochastic processes.
    This approach will allow to capture these uncertainties and be able to obtain sensible
    distributions of key financial metrics, such as NPV and VAR.\\

    prices and interest rates stochastic processes, to obtain discounted cash flows.
