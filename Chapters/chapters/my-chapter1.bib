	abstract = {In this paper we derive power futures prices from a two-factor spot model being a generalization of the classical Schwartz-Smith commodity dynamics. We include non-Gaussian effects by introducing Le´vy processes as the stochastic drivers, and estimate the model to data observed at the European Electricity Exchange in Germany. The spot and futures price models are ﬁtted jointly, including the market price of risk parameterized from an Esscher transform. We apply this model to price call and put options on power futures. It is argued theoretically that the pricing measure for options may be different to the pricing measure of futures from spot in power markets due to the non-storability of the electricity spot. Empirical evidence pointing to this fact is found from option prices observed at the European Electricity Exchange.},

	abstract = {Since the liberalization of electricity markets, electricity prices are more volatile and expansion in electricity derivatives trading occurs. Indeed, a well-known feature of electricity prices concerns its high volatility. For this reason, operators use power futures to hedge against unexpected risk deriving from adverse fluctuations of spot prices within the planned delivering period. Indeed, futures contracts permit to fix the price of electricity in advance for the use in the scheduled period. Our paper is devoted specifically to the Italian electricity market. In this respect, we examine empirical data from IDEX, the Energy Derivatives part of the Italian derivatives market IDEM, administered by “Borsa Italiana.” We finally survey the possible connections concerning futures and spot prices and, as a consequence, we deduce information about important indicators whereof the ex-post risk premium and the net convenience yield. For this purpose, we use several regression techniques to determine suitable explanatory variables inherent the Italian market for the ex-post risk premium and the net convenience yield.},

Weather-related derivatives are being employed more frequently in alternative risk portfolios with multiple asset classes. We ﬁrst propose an uncertain process that uses data from the past to describe how the temperature has changed. Despite this, pricing these assets is diﬃcult since it necessitates an incomplete market framework. The volatility is described by a truncated Fourier series, and we provide a novel technique for calculating this constant using Monte Carlo simulations. With this approach, the risk is assumed to have a ﬁxed market price.},

This order belongs to the family of complex orders, which introduce non-convexities in the market clearing problem. We demonstrate via simple numerical examples that if more of such bids are present in the market, their interplay may open the possibility of strategic bidding. More precisely, we show that by the manipulation of bid parameters, a strategic player may increase its own proﬁt and potentially induce the deactivation of an other minimum income condition order, which would be accepted under truthful bidding. Furthermore, we show that if we modify the objective function used in the market clearing according to principles suggested in the literature, it is possible to prevent the possibility of such strategic bidding, but the modiﬁcation raises other issues.},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy has introduced great risks to energy systems and markets. As a result, extensive research on energy storage systems (ESS) has been undertaken to address the risks caused by renewable energy. Among different types of ESSs, the power-to-gas (P2G) storage devices are of great potential. Thus, P2G has been used in this paper as a storage device to provide gas fuel for gas power generators. The aim of this paper is to investigate a portfolio strategy for gas generators to earn profits and hedge risks in three different electricity markets, namely, the spot, the ancillary, and the financial markets. The presented approach is to apply energy storage and financial derivatives to hedge the market risks of gas generators, including short put option and short call option, and the option value deduction process is also involved. Sim­ ulations are carried out based on the real historical data from 2016 to 2018 in Australian electricity markets. Three cases are presented, namely, the traditional model, the individual market case, and the proposed portfolio model. Based on the comparison of the three cases, simulation results show that the proposed portfolio model will help gas generators to earn a return of 1.0429 and hedge risks down to 0.0018. It has been found that the returns of the proposed model from 2016 to 2018 are 26.3\% higher, whereas the risks are 88.1\% lower on average comparing with the traditional model and the individual market case.},

We make three contributions to the literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a detailed econometric analysis of the wind power futures underlying, i.e., the electricity production based on windmills, resulting in strong support of seasonality and mean reversion in the logit-transformed wind power load factors. Second, after proposing a new model of wind power load factors based on the econometric findings, we analyse the theoretical prices of wind power futures and call option contracts to which the good-deal bounds pricing within an illiquid market situation is applied as well as we show the application of the theory to the practical pricing with the illiquidity. Third, our empirical pricing analysis shows that theoretical wind power futures prices derived using seasonal modelling more accurately reflect reality than those derived without seasonality compared to market observations, resulting in the importance of seasonality modelling in theoretical wind power derivatives pricing. In particular, considering that the upper and lower price boundaries represent the selling and the buying prices in the incomplete market, respectively, we show that the pricing of the short position is more affected by the seasonality than the pricing of the long position. Finally, we illustrate and discuss the practical applications of the results obtained in our study.},

	abstract = {Our article provides a better understanding of risk management strategies for all energy market stakeholders. A good knowledge of optimal risk hedging strategies is not only important for energy companies but also for regulators and policy makers in a context of climate emergency. Indeed, the electricity sector is key to achieve energy and ecological transition. Electricity companies should be on frontline of climate change struggle. Taking the perspective of electricity retailers, we analyze a range of portfolios made of forward contracts and/or power plants for specific hourly clusters based on electricity market data from the integrated German-Austrian spot market. We prove that intra-day hedging with forward contracts is sub-optimal compared to financial options and physical assets. By demonstrating the contribution of intra-day hedging with options and physical assets, we highlight the specificities of electricity markets as hourly markets with strong volatility during peak hours. By simulating optimal hedging strategies, our article proposes a range of new portfolios for electricity retailers to manage their risks and reduce their sourcing costs. A lower hedging cost enables to allocate more resources to digitalization and energy efficiency services to take into account customers’ expectations for more climatefriendly retailers. This is a virtuous circle. Retailers provide high value-added energy efficiency services so that consumers consume less. The latter contributes to reach electricity reduction targets to fight climate warming.},

Currently, generators have limited options for transferring the resulting wind-related volume risks. The European Energy Exchange (EEX) recently introduced exchange-traded wind power futures to address this market imperfection. We propose a stylized equilibrium pricing model featuring two representative agents and analyze equilibrium prices as well as the mechanics behind risk premia for wind power futures. We calibrate and simulate stochastic models for wind power generation, power prices, electricity demand, as well as other relevant sources of uncertainty and use the resulting scenarios to conduct a case study for the German market; analyzing prices, hedging effectiveness, and risk premia. Our main result suggests that wind generators are willing to pay an insurance premium to conventional generators to reduce their risks. We conduct a thorough sensitivity analysis to test the inﬂuence of model parameters and ﬁnd that our results on risk premia hold for a broad range of reasonable inputs.},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy has introduced great risks to energy systems and markets. As a result, extensive research on energy storage systems (ESS) has been undertaken to address the risks caused by renewable energy. Among different types of ESSs, the power-to-gas (P2G) storage devices are of great potential. Thus, P2G has been used in this paper as a storage device to provide gas fuel for gas power generators. The aim of this paper is to investigate a portfolio strategy for gas generators to earn profits and hedge risks in three different electricity markets, namely, the spot, the ancillary, and the financial markets. The presented approach is to apply energy storage and financial derivatives to hedge the market risks of gas generators, including short put option and short call option, and the option value deduction process is also involved. Simulations are carried out based on the real historical data from 2016 to 2018 in Australian electricity markets. Three cases are presented, namely, the traditional model, the individual market case, and the proposed portfolio model. Based on the comparison of the three cases, simulation results show that the proposed portfolio model will help gas generators to earn a return of 1.0429 and hedge risks down to 0.0018. It has been found that the returns of the proposed model from 2016 to 2018 are 26.3\% higher, whereas the risks are 88.1\% lower on average comparing with the traditional model and the individual market case.},

Taking the view of an owner of such a physical renewable asset we showcase the management of the associated stochastic production risks in Germany, one of the most dynamic electricity markets and the largest producer of renewable energy in the EU-28. We find that unhedged renewable portfolios are very risky and existing vanilla derivatives are poor hedges. New exotic quantity-related weather contracts proposed by major energy exchanges (EEX) show a lot of potential but are still very illiquid. Their hedging performance is heavily driven by the market wide renewable generation portfolio which, in its current state, favors specific regions. In the long-run price-related derivatives will transform into more useful hedging instruments due to the growing importance of renewables in the formation of wholesale market prices.},

Weather-related derivatives are being employed more frequently in alternative risk portfolios with multiple asset classes. We first propose an uncertain process that uses data from the past to describe how the temperature has changed. Despite this, pricing these assets is difficult since it necessitates an incomplete market framework. The volatility is described by a truncated Fourier series, and we provide a novel technique for calculating this constant using Monte Carlo simulations. With this approach, the risk is assumed to have a fixed market price.},

	abstract = {Predicting future solar conditions is important for electricity industries with solar power generators to quote a day-ahead sales contract in the electricity market. If a prediction error exists, the market-monitoring agent has to prepare another power generation resource to immediately compensate for the shortage, resulting in an additional cost. In this context, a penalty may be required depending on the size of the prediction error, which may lead to a significant loss for solar power producers. Because the main source of such losses is from prediction errors of solar conditions, they can instead effectively utilize a derivative contract based on solar prediction errors. The objective of this work is to provide such a derivative contract, namely, a prediction error weather derivative. First, defining a certain loss function, we measure the hedge effect of the derivative on solar radiation prediction error, thereby verifying that the existing hedging method for wind power can also be applied to solar power generation with periodic trends. By introducing the temperature derivative on the absolute prediction error, we also propose a cross-hedging method, where we demonstrate not only a further variance reduction effect when used with solar radiation derivatives, but also a certain hedge effect obtained even when only the temperature derivative is used. For temperature derivative pricing and optimal contract volume estimation, we propose a method using a tensor-product spline function that simultaneously incorporates the smoothing conditions of both the direction of intraday time trend and seasonal trend, and consequently verify its effectiveness.},

The book also contains a study of a new model, the delayed Heston model, which improves the volatility surface fitting as compared with the classical Heston model. The author calculates variance and volatility swaps for this model and provides hedging techniques. The book considers content on the pricing of variance and volatility swaps and option pricing formula for mean-reverting models in energy markets.

	abstract = {​Weather derivatives are financial instruments that can be used by organizations or individuals as part of a risk management strategy to minimize risk associated with adverse or unexpected weather conditions. Just as traditional contingent claims, a weather derivative has an underlying measure, such as: rainfall, wind, snow or temperature. Nearly \$1 trillion of the U.S. economy is directly exposed to weather-related risk. More precisely, almost 30\% of the U.S. economy and 70\% of U.S. companies are affected by weather. The purpose of this monograph is to conduct an in-depth analysis of financial products that are traded in the weather market. Presenting a pricing and modeling approach for weather derivatives written on various underlying weather variables will help students, researchers, and industry professionals accurately price weather derivatives, and will provide strategies for effectively hedging against weather-related risk. This book will link the mathematical aspects of the modeling procedure of weather variables to the financial markets and the pricing of weather derivatives. Very little has been published in the area of weather risk, and this volume will appeal to graduate-level students and researchers studying financial mathematics, risk management, or energy finance, in addition to investors and professionals within the financial services industry. ​},

	abstract = {Weather derivatives provide a tool for weather risk management, and the markets for these exotic financial products are gradually emerging in size and importance. This unique monograph presents a unified approach to the modeling and analysis of such weather derivatives, including financial contracts on temperature, wind and rain. Based on a deep statistical analysis of weather factors, sophisticated stochastic processes are introduced modeling the time and space dynamics. Applying ideas from the modern theory of mathematical finance, weather derivatives are priced, and questions of hedging analyzed. The treatise contains an in-depth analysis of typical weather contracts traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), including so-called CDD and HDD futures. The statistical analysis of weather variables is based on a large data set from Lithuania. The monograph includes the research done by the authors over the last decade on weather markets. Their work has gained considerable attention, and has been applied in many contexts.},

	abstract = {We develop a multivariate Lévy model and apply the bivariate model for the pricing of quanto options that captures three characteristics observed in real-world markets for stock prices and currencies: jumps, heavy tails and skewness. The model is developed by using a bottom-up approach from a subordinator. We do so by replacing the time of a Brownian motion with a Lévy process, exponential tilting subordinator. We refer to this model as a multivariate exponential tilting process. We then compare using a time series of daily log-returns and market prices of European-style quanto options the relative performance of the exponential tilting process to that of the Black–Scholes and the normal tempered stable process. We find that, due to more flexibility on capturing the information of tails and skewness, the proposed modeling process is superior to the other two processes for fitting market distribution and pricing quanto options.},

	abstract = {The paper focuses on the role of climate and weather derivatives (CDs/WDs for short) as instruments to hedge climate risk. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) we introduce a copula-based pricing methodology for multivariate CDs/WDs, whose flexible theoretical framework allows to be suited to any pricing application and possible structure of multivariate products, and (ii) we discuss the impact of CDs/WDs on climate risk and their implication for financial stability. Using the proposed framework, we illustrate a calibration example on a case study on Italian data. We find that Archimedean copula functions characterized by left tail dependence are generally more suitable to fit the data, depending on the season and the location. We also explore the advantages of using more sophisticated, i.e. multivariate, functions and assess the improvement of fitting. Subsequently, leveraging both the theoretical model and the empirical results, we discuss the relation between climate risk hedging and financial stability. Especially, we move from modeling complexities and limitations to illustrate how incorrect calculations (i.e. mispricings, or over/under estimations of capital at risk) can, alongside with climate change effect, increase rather than reduce the climate physical risk and hence the concerns for financial stability. Finally, we discuss this point in relation with the legislative framework, noting how, in the current context of uncertain legislation and imperfect pricing, climate hedging risks are likely to do more harm than good.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of commercial activities whose profit and cost are correlated with weather risk makes weather derivatives valuable financial instruments that enable hedging of price or volumetric (quantity) risk in many industries. This paper proposes a multi-period equilibrium pricing model for weather derivative. In our stylized economy representative agents of weather-sensitive industries optimizes their hedging portfolios that drive the supply and demand for weather derivative which are dynamically determined based on a utility indifference pricing framework. At equilibrium the weather derivative market will be cleared and their market price can be obtained. Numerical examples illustrate the equilibrium prices and optimal choices for the weather derivative as function of the correlation between weather indices and demand for the underlying commodity. We also demonstrate the benefit of multiple trading opportunities which allows rebalancing of the hedging portfolio prior to the commodity delivery date, as compared to a single shot framework.},

Then, by building up a system of models for energy and temperature, we proposed a dynamic hedging strategy for the hedge of the energy futures using temperature futures.},

	abstract = {We introduce the industrial portfolio of a wind farm of a hypothetical company and its valuation consistent with the financial market. Next, we propose a static risk management policy originating from hedging against volumetric risk due to drops in wind intensity and we discuss the consequences. The hedging effectiveness firstly requires adequate modeling calibration and an extensive knowledge of these atypical financial (commodity) markets. In this hedging experiment, we find significant benefits for weather-sensitive companies, which can lead to new business opportunities. We provide a new financial econometrics approach to derive weather risk exposure in a typical wind farm. Our results show how accurate risk management can have a real benefit on corporate revenues. Specifically, we apply the spot market price simulation (SMaPS) model for the spot price of electricity. The parameters are calibrated using the prices of the French day-ahead market, and the historical series of the total hourly load is used as the final consumption. Next, we analyze wind speed and its relationship with electricity spot prices. As our main contribution, we demonstrate the effects of a hypothetical hedging strategy with collar options implemented against volumetric risk to satisfy demand at a specific time. Regarding the hedged portfolio, we observe that the “worst value” increases considerably while the earnings-at-risk (EaR) decreases. We consider only volumetric risk management, thus neglecting the market risk associated with electricity price volatility, allowing us to conclude that the hedging operation of our industrial portfolio provides substantial benefits in terms of the worst-case scenario.},
