Title: \textbf{Monte Carlo Simulation Study using bayesian time series for energy hedging strategies}

# Abstract needs to be 150-250 words long
    The main objective of this study is to develop a Bayesian time series model for energy hedging strategies.
    The model will be used to generate scenarios for renewable asset generation.
    Asset historical data will be used and other relevant exogenous variables such as wind speed, irradiation and temperature when available.
    Using Monte Carlo simulation, the model will provide sensible medium/long term scenarios for energy generation.
    This will allow understanding the characteristic distribution of each cluster and the overall agent's risk exposure to generation risk.
    The model will be validated analysing if covariances and correlations are consistent with historical data.
    The study will contribute to the existing literature on energy hedging strategies and will provide valuable insights for energy companies to manage their risk exposure.
